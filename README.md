## 🔖 Description 🔖

The WishList Wizard app is designed to help users save and track gift and present ideas for special occasions, such as Christmas. It allows users to create a list of gifts, including the recipient's name, occasion, and gift details (e.g. product name, desired price, etc.). The app then uses price comparison engines to track the prices of the items on the user's list and sends notifications to the user when the price of an item reaches their desired price or is discounted by more than 25% or another specified percentage.

In addition to creating gift lists for others, the app also allows users to create a personal wishlist of items they want to purchase for themselves. Users can save flight information and receive notifications when the price of a flight drops below a specified amount. The app also includes user preference settings, allowing users to customize the types of notifications they receive and the frequency at which they receive them.

Overall, the app is intended to make it easier for users to save and track gift ideas and get notified when the prices of those items change, helping them to find the best deals and save money on their holiday shopping.
